											<ul>
												<p>
													To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:

                                            Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across Texas to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated Elevate the status of pets to that of family member From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services it offers. Pupps And Paws Adopt-A-Pet App also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.

                                            Pupps And Paws Adopt-A-Pet App is updated regularly.

                                            Organizations wishing to participate should register. A contact person should be responsible for direct communications with Pupps And Paws Adopt-A-Pet App. Only nonprofit organizations will be included (but Federal 501(c)(3) status is not necessary).

												<h4>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is an acronym for ways one can operate on stored data. It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage.</h4>
											        In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete are the four basic operations of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports.

												<h4>What is a README File?</h4>
												<p>In simple words, we can describe a README file as a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project you have worked on.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running. README is helpful To understand our prjoect for contributions made by others, provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected by adding visual aids, screenshots. Also if our project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

Here are a few extra points to note when you're writing your README:

Keep it up-to-date - It is a good practise to make sure your file is always up-to-date. In case there are changes make sure to update the file where necessary. Pick a language - We all come from different zones and we all speak different languages. But this does not mean you need to translate your code into vernacular. Writing your README in English will work since English is a globally accepted language. You might want to use a translator tool here if your target audience isn't familiar with English.

If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

*The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:</p>
<p><ul><h5>*What your application does(user stories)?</h5>
As a user, I want to be able to login to my account, so that I can access my account.

As a user, I want my sensitive information encrypted, so that I can have higher levels of account security.

As a signed in user, I want to be granted authorization to my movie service, so that I have proper authorization to view it.

As a user, I want to have my favorite movies saved, so that I can access them at a later time.

As a user, I want to have various subscription options, so that I pick from a selection of choices.</ul></p>
<p><ul><h5>*What technologies you used?</h5>
NODEJS, sqlite3, Bootstrap 4, CSS3 and HTML 5, bcrypt, dotenv, express, express-basic-auth, express-jwt, jsonwebtoken, jwks-rsa, nodemon, sequelize.

<p><ul><h5>*Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.</h5>
AS a developer learning tokens and authenticating users was a challenge to implement initially.
As a backend developer multiple queries and updating tables was an initial challenge for me.
<ul>As a product manager looking for features that are in aligin with user's expectation was a challenge for MVP(minimum viable product ).</ul>

											<center><h2 class="major">SQL injection</h2>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="" alt="" /></a>
											</center>
											<p>SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.</p>
											<center><a href="#" class="image"><img src="https://spanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SQL-injection-attack-example.png", width="800" 
												height="500"  alt="" /></a></center>
											<h4>Some facts <div class=""></div></h4>
												<ul>
													How does SQL injection attack work?
													<li>
														An SQL injection attack consists of an insertion or injection of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. SQL commands are injected into data-plane input that affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.
													</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>Why do hackers use SQL injection?
													
													<li>Sometimes, data damage may be permanent. The motivations behind an SQL injection attack are often financial. Hackers might sell sensitive data on the dark web, or malicious groups may wish to give themselves an advantage by setting your business back</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>WHERE can I practice SQL injection?
													<li>SQL injection comes under web application security so you have to find the places where web applications are vulnerable some of the places are listed below.
														<br>Bwapp (php/Mysql)</br>
														<br>badstore (Perl)</br>
														<br>bodgelt store (Java/JSP)</br>
														<br>bazingaa (Php)</br>
														<br>butterfly security project (php)</br>
														<br>commix (php)</br>
														<br>cryptOMG (php)</br>
													</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>How common are SQL injection attacks?
													<li>For its "State of the Internet" report, Akamai analyzed data gathered from users of its Web application firewall technology between November 2017 and March 2019. The exercise shows that SQL injection (SQLi) now represents nearly two-thirds (65.1%) of all Web application attacks.</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>What is the best defense of SQL injection?
													<p><h5>Primary Defenses:</h5>
														<li>Option 1: Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries).</li>
														<li>Option 2: Use of Properly Constructed Stored Procedures.</li>
														<li>Option 3: Allow-list Input Validation.</li>
														<li>Option 4: Escaping All User Supplied Input.</li>
														<p><h5>Additional Defenses:</h5>
														<li>Also: Enforcing Least Privilegee</li>
														<li>Also: Performing Allow-list Input Validation as a Secondary Defense</li>
														</p>
													</p></ul>
												<ul>what are the Symptoms of SQLi?
													<li>Receiving an excessive number of requests within a short timeframe. For example, you may see numerous emails from your webpage contact form.</li><li>Ads redirecting to suspicious websites.Strange popups and message errors.<li>Strange popups and message errors.</li></ul></li>
